DONE
- "this" behavior (refers to global object, with use strict...),
- Arguments passed by value, object passed by reference,
- The use of constructor function outside a class ?
- Difference between call and apply (just the array for the apply
method ?)
- Flat map : can we used flat map with an array like [[1], [2, 3]]
- Cycle life (forceUpdate, componentWilUnmount)
- Passed a state or a prop to a component
- Don't need to define props interface ?
- Why is the constructor mandatory ?
- Why have an onDelete prop ?
